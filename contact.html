              <span class="drop-cap">M</span>y journey into design is a funny
              one. I had always wished to get into a creative profession but
              never thought I had the right credentials to do so. Even with
              an Archiecture major in my hand, I didn't think I was qualified
              enough to be a full-time designer without further education in
              something called "full-time designer". Call it a symptom
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward to January 2014 when my boss took me on a strategic
              cookie walk and planted this idea of being a designer into my
              head. He invited me to a sketch session for what would be one of
              our biggest features and assured me that I had relevant
              experience working with our customers and would be able to bring
              a unique perspective to the table.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I started to think about design this way, I began to
              participate more in the Design discussions and even started taking
              on some side projects. Since our Design resources were understaffed,
              people began to ask me to take on some more responsibilities and
              I never said no. I didn’t mind working the extra hours after my
              "real job" since creating new expreiences and iderating on these
              ideas fulfilled my creative itch. Having found success with these
              side projects and thoroughly enjoying this process, I decided to
              tackle on design full-time, thus becoming the Accidental Designer.

                After taking on all these side projects and having

                That one time my colleagues and I pretended to be

                that be, of course!)

                Luckily landed my first "real job" in the "real
                world" as a Customer Confidence Advocate at
                Yesware. This was where I learned about our users
                and advocated on their behalf for their issues
                and pain points. Talking to users everyday and
                learning how they used the product was incredibly
                eye-opening and a great primer to empathy-driven
                design.
