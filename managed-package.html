            <h5>The Problem</h5>
            <p>
              The Yesware experience has always been focused on keeping the sales
              rep in the one place they work: their email inbox. With the shift
              to investing in sales managers, we learned that managers weren&rsquo;t
              able to break away from the Salesforce interface like the reps could.
              To cater to the managers, do we break our philosophy of keeping the
              user out of the clunky Salesforce interface? Or do we attempt to
              integrate seamlessly into Salesforce, like we have done with Gmail
              and Outlook?

              As the Lead Designer for the Managed Package project, I was responsible
              for creating low-fidelity wireframes (20%), conducting usability tests
              (20%), creating high-fidelity wireframes (20%), and building the frontend
              components in HTML, CSS, and jQuery (40%).

              Experience project, we learned that one of the most requested
              enhancements was to increase our reporting presence in Salesforce.
              Marissa and the other managers wished to cut down the number of
              platforms and places needed to monitor their team&rsquo;s progress.

              <span class="drop-cap">O</span>ne thing that was abundantly
              clear in the beginning was that the majority of sales managers
              lived in Salesforce&mdash;not by choice but because all the
              information they needed to report to their VPs was in
              Salesforce. Even though our sales rep experience is targeted
              around keeping reps in their inbox, we couldn&rsquo;t apply
              the same method to the sales managers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, I collaborated with our in-house Salesforce expert
              and our development team to build a Salesforce managed package
              that would host all of our existing Yesware reports and one
              new Salesforce dashboard that we had yet to create.

              <span class="drop-cap">G</span>etting the existing Yesware
              Reports into Salesforce was pretty straightforward. All we
              needed to figure out on the design side was to determine how
              these reports would be presented in Salesforce. The biggest
              chunk that we needed to plan was the new Salesforce dashboard
              that would be included as a part of this new managed package.
            </p>
            <p>
              We didn&rsquo;t do any formal user research for this project
              for 2 reasons:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  We were on a tight schedule and had 4 weeks to complete
                  the project from ideation to production.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We had a good place to start from. Our Salesforce expert
                  talked to customers everyday about their reporting needs
                  and helped them build these reports. This meant that she
                  had 2 years of feedback and sample reports that she had
                  created for customers in the past, so all we needed to
                  do was organize these metrics and focus on how we wanted
                  to convey this information.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
              After sifting through these reports, we decided to take one
              of the existing Salesforce reports that she had built and
              visualize it in a different manner. One of the limitations
              with native Salesforce reporting is that it lacks customization
              of the layouts and visual elements. While this can be a good
              thing (because it enables anyone to easily create reports on
              the fly), the reports can become cluttered, complicated, and
              difficult to digest in one sitting.

              <span class="drop-cap">N</span>ow that we knew what we wanted to
              create, the two of us began to scope out everything that would
              need to be done. Since neither the Salesforce expert nor I was
              a full-time developer, we decided to re-use one of the existing
              report templates that our colleague had created a couple months
              prior. This meant that most of the technical framework could be
              re-used, and all we had to do was focus on querying the data in
              Salesforce (her job) and ensure that the visuals and interactions
              of the template could be easily tweaked (my job).
            </p>
            <p>
              From here, we split paths to focus on our separate tasks. I
              started by creating a low-fidelity wireframe to ensure that all
              the requirements have been met before we began to implement the
              new solution. I tried out a couple different layouts to make sure
              that this new report that we were building also fit in well with
              our existing reports.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, I took two variations of the low-fidelity mockups to test
              with users. In addition to testing with Sales Managers (who we
              were building these reports for), I also recruited people from
              Sales Operations (as they would be the ones downloading and
              installing this managed package).
            </p>
            <p>
              Armed with this new knowledge, I took everyone&rsquo;s feedback and
              created a high-fidelity mockup. Below, you can see the similarities
              between the old template and the new template. I wanted to
              introduce these visual tweaks to differentiate the two reports
              (to make the user feel like they&rsquo;re getting a brand new report),
              improve readability (by bumping up the font size from 10px to 14px
              and sectioning out the cards into their own row), and make the
              report responsive (as we heard during the usability research that
              managers would love to display these reports on their TV
              leaderboards).
            </p>
            <img src="images/managed-package/template-comparison.png" alt="Original template vs. Update template" />
            <p class="caption">
              Starting template is on the left. Updated template is on the right.
            </p>
            <p>
              The other aspect that I needed to flesh out was the permissioning
              of these reports. Yesware has different plans with different
              capability sets, and these reports fell into this model as well.
              Some reports were available to everyone, some to our Team and
              Enterprise customers, and our newest reports were only available
              on our Premier customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to this permissioning of the reports, we also needed
              to account for different user types. These reports would only be
              made available to Yesware users who are logged into their accounts,
              so I created some teasers for new users and users who weren&rsquo;t
              signed in so they could get a sneak peek of the value before
              committing to signing up.

              a good 6 hours of uninterrupted coding time as much as the next
              person. But it does mean that I usually keep the designs pretty
              simple and understand that it&rsquo;s not the appropriate time
              to experiment with crazy visualizations. (I leave those to our

              <span class="drop-cap">T</span>here were so many things that I
              learned from working 1:1 with our Salesforce expert, but I have
              one simple takeaway that I&rsquo;ve taken to heart. She taught
              me that with reporting, you want to make sure that the numbers
              tell a compelling story. This is especially important when
              creating mockups or fake demo accounts because you want to be
              able to explain the value to the Sales Managers you&rsquo;re
              selling to.
            </p>
            <p>
              Never again will I bash my number keyboard when creating report
              mockups! After going through her spontaneous Sales Metrics Crash
              Course, I immediately went back to my Manager 1:1 Report mockup,
              Activity vs. Engagement Report mockup, and marketing assets to
              update the values in there. My teammates thought I went a tad
              overboard when I showed off my newly created Google spreadsheet
              that made sure my values and percentages were all calculated
              correctly.
