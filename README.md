<h1>portfolio</h1>
<p>Welcome!</p>
<p>Here, you will find the content and code used to build my portfolio. (Check it out <a href="www.christinelee.design">here</a> if you feel inclined).</p>
<p>Since this is the first personal project that I’m hosting on GitHub, it’s a little bit rough, but I would definitely appreciate any tidbits on best practices and other things to keep in mind while developing and hosting in GitHub.</p>
<p>Feel free to leave any constructive feedback in a pull request :)</p>
