<p>Since this is the first personal project that I’m hosting on GitHub, it’s a little bit rough, but I would definitely appreciate any tidbits on best practices or other things to keep in mind while developing and pushing code to GitHub.</p>
<p>Feel free to leave any constructive feedback in a pull request :)</p>
