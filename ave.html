            <h5>The Problem</h5>
            <p>
              Yesware&rsquo;s business model is that of B2C2B (business to
              consumer to business). We&rsquo;ve been targeting baseline sales
              reps in hopes that they will love the product enough to refer us
              to their colleagues and managers, who will then introduce our tool
              to their company.
            </p>
            <p>
              As more sales reps began to install our product, managers began to
              see the value of Yesware for themselves. Despite this value that the
              managers found, many did not sign up for a license due to a disjointed
              user experience. Realizing that we had never optimized for sales managers,
              our Product team decided to invest in the manager experience, as they
              were decisionmakers in the buying process.

              to understand users&rsquo; pain points (20%), creating low-fidelity
              wireframes (15%), creating high-fidelity wireframes (15%), and
              conducting usability tests (50%).

              <span class="drop-cap">M</span>eet Marissa&mdash;a Sales
              Development Manager at Skalaway*. Ask her anything about
              the sales process, and she&rsquo;ll give you a concise
              2 minute overview in layman&rsquo;s terms. Marissa oversees
              a team of 7-10 Sales Development Reps (SDRs) that is
              responsible for qualifying leads that are ultimately handed
              off to the &ldquo;closers&rdquo;, also known as Account
              Executives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of Marissa&rsquo;s daily efforts are spent around coaching
              her team. Most SDRs are fresh out of college, so they not
              only need coaching for their roles but also training on
              the general sales process. In addition to weekly Lunch
              and Learns, Marissa also spends 1:1 time with each rep
              to individually coach them through specific prospecting
              techniques and strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since her performance is measured by the success of her
              team, Marissa needs to know that her team is emailing
              and calling enough leads, as well as booking enough
              meetings with leads that turn into closed-won opportunities.

              <span class="drop-cap">A</span>fter talking with Marissa,
              we discovered that there was a lot of room for improvement
              on the reporting aspect of her role. When asked if she had
              any pain points, Marissa would politely say she had none
              but would then go on to describe how she spends around 6-8
              hours every week to compile a report that tracks her
              team&rsquo;s activity and success.
            </p>
            <p>
              Marissa wasn&rsquo;t the only sales manager with this problem.
              After interviewing 7 other managers, we noticed a couple
              recurring pain points:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Sales managers don&rsquo;t have actionable data when
                  coaching their reps to become more efficient and to hit
                  their goals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sales managers don&rsquo;t have enough insight into their
                  reps&rsquo; activities when coaching their reps.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sales managers had no reports to look over during their 1:1s
                  with their direct reports.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sales managers wanted to know what the formula for success
                  looked like so that they turn it into a repeatable process.<br />
                  - <em>How many emails does it take to get a reply?</em><br />
                  - <em>How many calls does it take to book a meeting?</em>
                </li>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sales managers have to look in many different places to
                  see the high-level metrics they care about, so gathering
                  these metrics is very time consuming. <br /><br />
                  For example, there wasn&rsquo;t an easy way to tie an
                  SDR&rsquo;s effort to revenue generated. This process
                  was very manual. Sales managers were tracking this in
                  Google spreadsheets, going to each Account page in
                  Salesforce, then combing through the Activity History
                  to look for Opportunities Opened.
                </li>

              we could dive deeper into. This motivation to help tackle the
              sales manager&rsquo;s pain points was also further fueled by
              Yesware&rsquo;s business objectives. As a company, we had
              always focused on individual sales reps, thus denying the
              managers a usable experience. In tackling the issue at hand,
              not only would we be able to deliver incremental value to the
              manager through simplifying the metric-gathering process, but
              we could also solidify our position amongst our customers as a
              trustworthy expert in sales, capture managers organically (thus
              expediting our growth initiative), and also charge more for a
              reporting add-on.

              <span class="drop-cap">O</span>ne of the coolest perks of working
              at Yesware as a Product Designer is that we have customers who
              are very eager and happy to give us feedback and participate in
              usability sessions. That&rsquo;s right&mdash;our customers <em>want</em>
              to hop on the phone and talk with us. Not only that, but our
              internal sales team uses our product everyday and always provides
              valuable feedback, both as Yesware users and advocates for the
              prospects they talk to on a daily basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              With our problem statement in hand, we figured it would be a good
              idea to start chatting with our sales team. Our desire to help
              <em>all</em> the managers with <em>all</em> their problems was quickly
              squashed, as we discovered how varied their responsibilities and
              goals were. Now we had to choose a focus. What would it look like
              if we focused our efforts on helping SDR Managers? Inside Sales
              Managers? Enterprise Managers?
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, we decided to hone in on helping SDR managers because
              they are focused on tracking their team&rsquo;s activity. Metrics
              like # emails sent, # calls made, # replies received, etc. were all
              numbers that we had access to, so it seemed like the simplest
              and most logical place to start adding value.

              <span class="drop-cap">N</span>ow that we had a plan of attack,
              it was time to hoard some snacks because my fellow Product
              Manager and I were camping out in the call rooms, talking to
              customers non-stop. Broken down by tasks, this is how the next
              3 months played out:
            </p>
            <h2>User Research Interviews</h2>
            <p>
              The Product Manager and I conducted 6 user research interviews
              with SDR Managers to validate our 2 hypotheses:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If we tell managers how much activity their team needs to
                  complete to hit their goals, then they will know how to coach
                  their team members towards hitting those goals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If we tell managers how much activity their team has completed
                  this month, then they will be able to tell whether or not their
                  teams are on track to hit their goals throughout the month.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Sketch Session (Round 1)</h2>
            <p>
              Armed with this new knowledge, we led the first round of sketch
              sessions with the Design + Product teams to flesh out high level
              ideas gathered from the research interviews.
            </p>
            <img src="images/ave/sketch-session-1.png" alt="" /><br />
            <h2>Low-Fidelity Mockups</h2>
            <p>
              Based on the sketches from the sketch session, I created 4
              low-fidelity mockups to test the different directions.
            </p>
            <img src="images/ave/4-variations.png" alt="" /><br />
            <p>
              From top left (clockwise):
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <em>1:1 Email</em> - a weekly email digest that preps managers for
                  their 1:1s with their direct reports
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>BDR Activity Dashboard</em> - a real-time dashboard that shows
                  managers what activity their reps are generating
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>BDR Goals + Activity Dashboard</em> - a progress report that
                  shows managers how their team is performing in relation to
                  their monthly goals
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Sales Effort Dashboard</em> - a calculator that lets managers
                  see how many deals their reps need to close to hit their
                  monthly quota
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Usability Testing (Round 1)</h2>
            <p>
              The Product Manager and I conducted 6 usability test sessions to
              see which ideas resonated most with our target users. Here, we
              validated that managers needed help tracking their team&rsquo;s
              activity in a more intuitive and consolidated manner and would
              likely use these reports when coaching their reps during 1:1s.
            </p>
            <h2>Experiment</h2>
            <p>
              Based on the validation from the usability tests and a couple
              brainstorm sessions, we created an experiment to help managers
              coach their reps in 1:1s. Managers didn&rsquo;t have a report to
              bring with them to their 1:1s, so we figured this would be a good
              place to start and would benefit both both reps and managers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Originally, we had wanted to scrape a manager&rsquo;s calendar for
              1:1s and send them an email with an activity summary so they would
              be prepared for their meeting. However, the cost of scraping
              calendars and the uncertainty in identifying 1:1s was expensive.
              So, in an effort to keep things simple, we decided to create an
              email that featured 4 activity metrics for a given SDR and whether
              they were on track to hit their goals. Rather than scraping the
              calendar, we decided to send these emails every Monday morning so
              that managers could prepare for the week ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
              There were 3 main things we wanted to test in this experiment:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <em>Do users find this report useful?</em><br />
                  We would track success by measuring open + click rates.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>What do users want to see in the drill down view?</em><br />
                  This led to a Google form so that we could collect
                  responses.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Is the cadence correct, or do they want to receive this
                  email at another time?</em><br />
                  This also led to a Google form, allowing users to suggest
                  alternative times.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
              Not only was this an experiment to test whether or not sales
              managers would use this in the wild, but it was also to verify
              that we could pull these metrics from Salesforce. We had dabbled
              with pulling data from Salesforce in the past but deemed it too
              costly given the extreme amount of engineering effort required to
              mine custom fields and KPIs. By validating that # Calls Made,
              # Meetings Booked, and # Opportunities Created were used
              universally, we were able to validate that our simplified query
              would work across multiple organizations. To help speed things up,
              I coded up the HTML template for this email and ended up developing
              <em>major</em> respect for email designers and a love/hate
              relationship with Litmus and Putsmail.

            <h2>Sketch Session (Round 2)</h2>
            <p>
              As we continued to monitor the Manager 1:1 experiment in the
              background, we also began work on kneading the feedback we received
              in the Google forms. Now that we had a clearer direction of what
              the manager&rsquo;s pain points and needs were, I conducted a second
              round of sketch sessions with the development team that would be
              working on this project (1 Product Manager, 4 engineers, myself).
              Since the engineers participated in this sketch session, we used
              this time to discuss feasibility and any technical constraints that
              might affect the design.

            <h2>Low-Fidelity Mockups</h2>
            <p>
              This sketch session spawned 2 different ideas to test:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  A <em>Scatterplot</em> which would make it clear how reps were
                  doing and offer actionable insight
                </li>
                <li>
                  An <em>Activity Snapshot</em> where various data points could
                  come together in one view
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <img src="images/ave/scatterplot-vs-dashboard.png" alt="" /><br />
            <p class="caption">

            <h2>Usability Tests (Round 2)</h2>
            <p>
              We conducted 6 sessions for Round 2. The Activity Snapshot
              initially caught most managers&rsquo; attention due to its
              familiar layout. But when the managers drilled down into the
              data, they found it redundant because this was information they
              already had access to in Salesforce. The Scatterplot took a
              little longer to understand. But after poking around a little
              more, managers were more excited by this design due to its unique
              visualization of information. The concept of plotting activity
              against engagement resonated with many managers because it
              captured their reps&rsquo; input and showed what the result of
              that effort was.

              and clear: Scatterplot trumps Snapshot. I went ahead and created
              a high fidelity mockup to flesh out not only the visual design
              but also the interactions and context to help managers understand
              what they were looking at.

              In parallel, the Manager 1:1 experiment was running along nicely.
              Of the 14 managers that we had sent the emails to, all 14 had
              opened the email, 2 offered more details as to what they would
              have liked to see, and only 1 requested to be removed from the
              list. Recognizing that this sample size would lead to inconclusive
              results, we decided to roll this experiment out to 50% of our
              target users. In the second iteration, we were also able to add
              more details around opportunities that were closed-won so that
              managers could better understand which deals had closed and what
              type of activity helped the deal close.

              <span class="drop-cap">A</span>rmed with these two reports and many
              other product improvements, our Sales & Marketing teams previewed
              both the Manager 1:1 Report and the Activity vs. Enagagement Report
              at Dreamforce 2015 (the biggest conference of the year in the sales
              industry), we ended up recruiting around 10 companies to beta test
              these 2 reports. In fact, the AvE report was hard at work pre-Dreamforce,
              when our CEO took screenshots of his invitee&rsquo;s reports and
              included those teasers in the invitations.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, these 2 reports were able to fulfill the
              business&rsquo;s objective of charging more for a Reporting Add-On.
              We created a brand new tier called &ldquo;Prescriptive Analytics&rdquo;
              to host these new reports and organized a huge
              <a href="https://www.yesware.com/prescriptive-analytics/">
              Marketing launch</a> around it.

            <p>
              It&rsquo;s still a bit too early to tell how successful this project has
              been since the Prescriptive Analytics Trial is still ongoing, but
              I&rsquo;d say that the initial momentum has been pretty good so far.
              We&rsquo;ve received a lot of feedback&mdash;both positive and
              constructive&mdash;regarding this report and have a good understanding of
              what our next steps look like. I&rsquo;m excited to continue reworking
              this report to ensure its success and will be back with an update to
              let you know how things pan out!
