            <p>
              Renters of "microhomes" (or homes that are less than 500 sq. feet)
              struggle with outfitting their apartment with appropriate furniture.

              I wanted to create a space dedicated to these tiny home inhabitants,
              where they can find inspiration on how to decorate their space to
              maximize every square foot while also making the space livable and
              comfortable.

                with a BA degree in Economics, she's ready to take her first
                steps in tackling "real life."
              </p>
              <p>
                Having always dreamed of living in the city on her own, she
                began to look for apartments that would be close to her new
                workplace. As a self-proclaimed introvert, she knew that she'd
                need to have her own space in order to enjoy the hustle and
                bustle of the city while still being able to come back to
                her own sanctuary.
              </p>
              <p>
                After weeks of dealing with reality and realizing that she
                wouldn't be able to land her dream apartment right out of
                college, Catarina finally settled for a 260 sq. ft. apartment
                in the heart of downtown. Since she is paying top dollar for
                her space ($6/sq. ft.), she wants to make use of every
                nook and cranny to fully take advantage of her new home.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a new grad and young professional, Catarina is on a tight
                budget. However, she never let that interfere with her interest
                in good design, as she seeks out functional pieces and receives
                joy from being surrounded by interesting art.

                <span class="drop-cap">O</span>n the other side of the
                spectrum is Brandon, who like Catarina, is also a young professional.
                Nearing 30, Brandon is quite enjoying his life in the city,
                resisting the urge to settle down and move to the suburbs like
                most of his friends.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that he's had some time to save up and has the financial
                flexibility to upgrade to a bigger space, Brandon has grown to
                prefer living in his 515 sq. ft. studio. Not only is he thoroughly
                enjoying life in his swanky new high rise, but his studio is just
                big enough to pass for a 1 bedroom, is comfortable, and is easy
                to maintain (re: minimal cleaning necessary). He has everything
                he needs, so why bother upgrading to a bigger space?
              </p>
              <p>
                Since Brandon has decided to stay in a smaller space and is
                craving an upgrade from his trusty 10 year old Ikea furniture,
                he now has some capital to invest in some "grown-up" pieces
                for his apartment.

              <span class="drop-cap">N</span>ow that we've met both Catarina
              and Brandon and got a glimpse of their lifestyles, we can begin
              to see how young professionals are living in Boston nowadays.
              With rentprices steadily increasing for 1 person households in
              the Greater Boston area, it is getting more difficult to find
              a space that's large, close to the city, and affordable.
            </p>
            <img src="images/nico/choose-2.png" alt="Choose 2" /><br />
            <p>
              Because of this predicament, more and more young professionals
              are sacrificing space to be close to the city. One of Catarina
              and Brandon's biggest struggle is finding inspiration and
              furniture for their tiny apartments. A quick Google Image search
              reveals futuristic homes that have hidden cubbies and pull-out
              walls that can transform a kitchen into a bedroom into a living
              room, yet many of these microhomes have been custom built with
              the space constraint in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              These solutions are not appropriate for renters like Catarina
              and Brandon, as they don't have the authority to remodel their
              property. This leaves microhome renters with a hefty wishlist,
              yet no solutions for how to organize their space.

              <span class="drop-cap">T</span>o start things off, I began
              by talking to potential Ni.co users such as Catarina and Brandon
              to get to the crux of the problem at hand. What other sites
              have they used to look for small-space furniture? What did
              they like / not like about these sites? What apps do they enjoy
              using? What kind of design aesthetic do they gravitate towards?
              Are they casual browsers or do they scour the Internet with a
              specific item in mind?
            </p>

            <p>
              At first, these questions may seem excessive, almost
              interrogative, but really understanding where the user is coming
              from and what they want to accomplish always helps with driving
              the design.
            </p>

            <p>
              After getting a good handle on the problem at hand, I began to
              scope out the rest of the project. The next steps were to:

              process. The main goal of user stories for me is to help whittle
              down what the final vision of the product is, which then allows
              me to prioritize the tasks needed to be completed in order to
              achieve this vision.

              <span class="drop-cap">S</span>eeing that our target audience
              had a lot of interest and passion for good design, I wanted
              to make this acccessible in Ni.co's brand. When I think about
              urban living, I think of architecture. These are buildings that
              lend itself to geometry and structure&mdash;buildings that will
              be around for a while, so I decided to channel some of this
              aesthetic into Ni.co's brand.
            </p>
            <p>
              Objects that are structural in nature, if not done right,
              can also seem too perfect and cold. I wanted Ni.co to be
              approachable and relatable to the young clientele it would serve.
              I thought back to my Disneyland class in college (yes, it
              was a real class) and how they only used round shapes for their
              protaganists. To soften some of the more rigid structural elements,
              I decided to incorporate more of these circular shapes and add some
              softer pastel colors. You'll see this balance working throughout
              the Ni.co brand.
            </p>
            <p>
              To capture this initial visual direction, I created a moodboard
              focusing on color, type, and product photography.

            <p>
              As for the name "Ni.co", that came out of concatenation
              experimentation. Ni.co was born out of this exercise, and even
              though it's a combination of the words "Niche" + "Collection",
              the name "Ni.co" also sounds like it could be your personal
              interior decorating assistant, falling nicely in line with the
              assistant-as-app trend that has been taking over the internet.
              Talk about happy coincidences!

              Knowing where to start with interior decorating can be incredibly
              difficult, considering you have other things to worry about like
              where to find renters insurance, who's going to help you move, etc.
              This is why I decided to create a handpicked collection of items,
              ranging from furniture to lighting to decor, thus taking the
              guesswork out of where to start.

              Places like Ikea and West Elm currently have dedicated small space
              living sections on their website, but there isn't one space that
              caters to a variety of tastes and constraints. Brandon didn't
              care for Ikea pieces, as he wanted investment pieces and Catarina
              wouldn't be able to afford the selection at West Elm. Ni.co attempts
              to combine the best of both worlds, creating a suitable offering
              for both of our target users.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is why I introduced the idea of “Collections.” Every
              Collection has a theme, which would allow for Ni.co to accomodate
              different tastes and priorities. In addition to being able to
              appeal to many different users, Collections would allow Ni.co to
              scale and grow with their users.
            </p>

            <p>
              The other benefit Collections bring is to show the items in
              context, thus also serving as inspiration for how users can set
              up their space. Since each Collection is set up with the microhome
              in mind, users would be able to see exactly how to set it up in
              their own home.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ni.co helps renters of small spaces
              find inspiration on how to decorate their space to maximize every
              square foot while also making the space livable and comfortable.

              Ni.co was a theoretical project that I worked on for one of my
              Bloc assignments, so this is where the story ends for now. I
              learned a ton about how to set up ecommerce sites that optimize
              the browsing experience. Beacuse of this browsing focus, the
              Ni.co design was heavily influenced by some of my favorite fashion
              bloggers.

              As the Internet makes it easier for people to disseminate information,
              it's become easier for individuals to set up their own shops and blogs.
              This new wave of sites that is dedicated to a more niche shopping
              experience isa unique one, as shop owners are now able to directly
              communicate with their customers more often. It will be interesting
              to see how the ecommerce industry develops as business owners create
              more personalized experiences.
