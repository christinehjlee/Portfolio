            <p>
              One of Yesware's most popular features is called Mail Merge&mdash;
              a tool that allows high-volume prospecting reps to quickly reach out
              to potential customers. At the time, there was no easy way to 
              easily share these Mail Merges with the teams, making it difficult
              for team membres to quickly share successful messaging. As the
              number of prospecting reps grew amongst our user base, the need
              to share these campaigns grew as well.

              <span class="drop-cap">M</span>ail Merge is one of Yesware's
              most popular features. This tool was created for reps focused
              on high-volume prospecting to make it easier for them to reach
              out to leads using the same messaging. Rather than send 200 
              individual emails with the same email template, a rep could use
              Mail Merge to import their list of 200 prospects, insert the
              template, then Yesware would automatically send those emails
              from their inbox.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mail Merge was a huge hit when it was first rolled out x years
              ago. Since then, the Mail Merge user base has grown and their
              needs have evolved. Many users have requested an easier way to
              reuse their Mail Merges, especially if those Mail Merges are
              performing well.

              <span class="drop-cap">T</span>he interesting challenge that I
              had to face up front was that this wasn't the typical product
              development project with the refined process. Instead of coming
              from the Product team, this project came through the Customizations
              team. This meant that:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  There were more stakeholders involved in the project, which 
                  meant increased communication would be needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The scope and requirements had already been determined by
                  another team, so I had to accomodate that.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We were on a tight timeline, as we needed to deliver the
                  project on time, as the customer paid a hefty amount to have
                  this feature development accelerated.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
              From the design side, this proved to be incredibly challenging.
              Even though this was a Customization that 1 customer paid for,
              the plan was to release this feature to everyone shortly after.
              However, since the scope was already decided, how do we know
              that other customers are going to want the feature built this 
              way as well? Who trumps whom in the end: the customer who is 
              paying for expedited development or the rest of the userbase?
            </p>
            <p>
              The timing also proved to be especially challenging. In a typical
              product development cycle, designers stay ahead by 2 weeks so
              that we have enough time to validate, iterate, and incorporate
              technical limitations into the design. However, we were all 
              starting the project on the same day, which meant there were
              no validated designs to work with, and everyone had their own 
              ideas of how to approach the solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having said that, a couple challenges didn't stop us! We
              acknowledged them and did our best to mitigate where possible.
              I tried to incorporate the regular process but heavily condense
              it to fit our timeline (i.e. instead of scheduling 5 tests, I
              scheduled 3; instead of doing 2 rounds of iteration, I did 1).
              Nobody said that building software was easy, but our team was
              up for the challenge!

              the data model and restructuring the underlying architecture, I
              worked closely with the Product Manager and the Custom Solution
              Specialist to understand the requirements. We worked quickly so
              that I could create some prototypes to put in front of users.

              Many sketches of key scerens and user flows later, I converted
              these into high-fidelity prototypes. Having spent 2 years talking
              to customers, we've found that they respond best when they see
              a realistic version of the mockup instead of a wireframe-y 
              version.

              different people as possible, since we didn't get to do the formal
              user research at the start of the project. One of the places that
              I compromised on was hte user research phase. I figured that
              having a prototype to respond to would yield fast feedback, so
              this seemed like the optimal approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most interesting revelations from the first round of 
              user testing was that in addition to the need for sales managers
              to create and share Mail Merge Templates, the reps also wanted to
              have control over creating Mail Merge Templates. There seemed to be
              a natural tension between reps and maangers, as the former party
              wanted more control and autonomy over their outreach efforts, while
              the latter party wanted to help reps save time and closely guard
              the messaging being relayed prospects. In addition, the workflows
              of both managers and reps greatly differed, despite using the same 
              feature within the same interface. There was an even split: Reps
              preferred version B while managers preferred version A.
            </p>
            <p>
              Given the time constraint, there was no room for us to explore a 
              joint solution. My recommendation was to choose 1 persona and
              continue moving forward, and I would develop the other persona's
              solution on the side. Given this started off as a Customization,
              we decided to optimize for the managers and revisit the rep
              experience.

              the engineers just had to pull in the class name for an element
              and the styles would automatically be applied. Of course, there
              was some tweaking required, but we all determined this was a

              they requested several more enhancement such as error handling, 
              inserting from the Lead Page in Salesforce, and etc., which all 
              required some brief exploration of flows and visual design. 
              Once we received the A-OK from them, we began to slowly release
              the feature enhancement to other Mail Merge users.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though we had optimized for the sales managers' workflows,
              we were pleasantly surprised to see the usage numbers shoot up. 
              Nearly 30% of all Mail Merges were sent using a Mail Merge Template!
